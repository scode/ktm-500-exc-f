# Introduction

This is an unofficial owner's guide for the 2025 KTM 500 EXC-F.

It should be thought of as a companion to the official manual. It is not complete. It will contain information that I've
dug up and wanted to document for myself. Either because it's information that isn't in the manual at all (and requires
trolling the internet), or because information is in the manual but the manual is incredibly frustrating to use in
general and especially on a phone while you're working on the bike.

Emphasis on unofficial. Always double check information, especially safety critical, with official sources.
